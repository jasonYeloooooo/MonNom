KISS: start by inlining only for call_prim
- Huge majority of call sites are for primitive calls

First problems first: where do we put the call site counter? 
- On the version inst object?
- Seems suitable for now

When inlining, we recompile the call block, jump to an inlined entry block
in a new inlined CallCtx
- For now, could try just adding numLocals as extraLocals
- Ret needs special handling of inlined calls too

What about inlined call arguments???
- Map the values to the caller arg slot, but map the slot to the parent val?
- Requesting location for value yields parent slot/reg
- This remains valid so long as we don't overwrite the slot with something else









------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Inlining implementation:
- May need to allocate more stack slots for callee, bump stack pointers
- Start with arg values mapped in parent stack frame
  - CodeGenState needs to allow for this
- Need to be careful when spilling
  - Must test if parent values, if so, spill
  - Mark value as spilled in parent spill slot
- CodeGenState
  - map of regs to values
  - map of slots to values
  - values to regs and slots
  - if parent value, slot or reg to value has parent value, not callee arg


What do you mean by "test if parent value?" for arguments
